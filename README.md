# Python-Number-Converter
Basic number converter, to change between decimal, binary, hexadecimal

A number conversion program, i created this program as a mini test to help me progress my python learning.
The program allows the user to select the conversion they require.
Via both mathematical and built in functions, various number conversion are undertaken, e.g decimal to binary, binary to dec, dec to hexadecimal.

The reasoning behind both mathematical and built in was firstly to test myself as well as to double check my work.
