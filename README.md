# Python-Number-Converter
Basic number converter, to change between decimal, binary, hexadecimal

## Overview
A number conversion program, I created this program as a mini test to help me progress my Python learning.
The program allows the user to select the conversion they require.
Via both mathematical and built-in functions, various number conversions are undertaken, e.g. decimal to binary, binary to dec, and dec to hexadecimal.

The reasoning behind both mathematical and built-in was firstly to test myself and to double-check my work.
